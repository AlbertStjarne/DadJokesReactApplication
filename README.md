# A Dad Jokes application built in React

A Dad Jokes application built in React.

The application uses an API so by clicking the Fetch Jokes button you can fetch three new jokes. The jokes can be upvoted or downvoted by clicking he arrows. This changes color of the ring around the votes number and also the emoji on the right hand side. When jokes get voted on they are sorted with the most upvoted jokes at the top.

The list of jokes persists in localStorage.

The used API you can find at [https://icanhazdadjoke.com/](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)
